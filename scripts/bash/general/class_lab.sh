Part I: The Challenges
Processes & Daemons
1.	List a specific process: command to list all running processes associated with the daemon nginx.
2.	Kill by name: How do you kill all processes named my_script.sh without looking up their PIDs manually?
3.	Background execution: How do you run backup.sh in the background so it continues running even if you close the terminal (logout)?
4.	Find PID: Write a command to extract only the Process ID (PID) of the sshd daemon.
5.	Process Hierarchy: How do you view processes in a tree format to see which parent process spawned which child daemon?
6.	Open Files: How do you list all files currently opened by a process with PID 1234?
7.	Check Daemon Status: Using systemd, how do you check if the docker daemon is currently active?
8.	Priority: How do you start a command heavy_calc.sh with the lowest possible CPU priority (niceness)?
Files, Copying & Archiving
9.	Recursive Copy: Command to copy the folder /var/www/html to /backup/html recursively.
10.	Preserve Attributes: How do you copy a file secret.key to /tmp while strictly preserving its original timestamps, ownership, and permissions?
11.	Sync Directories: Use rsync to copy files from src/ to dest/, but only copy files that are newer in the source or missing in the destination.
12.	Update Copy: Use cp to copy files from dir1 to dir2, but only if the source file is newer than the destination file.
13.	Remote Copy: How do you Copy a local file app.conf to /etc/ on a remote server 192.168.1.50 using SSH/SCP?
14.	Archive & Compress: Create a .tar.gz archive of the /var/log directory.
The find Command
15.	Size Search: Find all files in /home that are larger than 500MB.
16.	Time Search: Find all files in /var/log that were modified in the last 7 days.
17.	User Search: Find all files in /tmp owned by the user jenkins.
18.	Find & Delete: Find all empty directories inside /data and delete them automatically.
19.	Permission Search: Find all files in the current directory that have full 777 permissions.
20.	Find & Copy: Find all files ending in .jpg in the current folder and copy them to /images/.
Regular Expressions (Grep, Sed, Awk)
21.	Email Extraction: Extract all valid email addresses from a text file contacts.txt using grep.
22.	Case Insensitive Search: Search for the string "error" in syslog regardless of capitalization (e.g., finds "Error", "ERROR", "error").
23.	Line Start Anchor: Find all lines in config.ini that strictly start with the word root.
24.	Invert Match: Display all lines in access.log that do not contain the IP 192.168.1.1.
25.	Recursive Grep: Search for the string "TODO" inside every text file in the current directory and all subdirectories.
26.	Sed Replace: Replace every occurrence of the word "localhost" with "127.0.0.1" in the file hosts.txt and save the changes in place.
27.	Comment Removal: Use sed or grep to view a configuration file without seeing lines that start with #.
28.	IP Validation: Use a regex to find lines that look like a standard IPv4 address (digit.digit.digit.digit format) in a file.
Complex Combinations
29.	Process & Regex: List all running processes, but filter the output to show only those running as root using grep.
30.	Find, Regex & Execute: Find all files named *.log, search inside them for the word "Critical", and print the filename if a match is found.
